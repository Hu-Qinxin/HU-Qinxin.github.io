        Northern Territory
        <p>The Northern Territory, a self-governing territory of Australia, occupies the central northern part of the continent. The Northern Territory is bounded by the Timor and Arafura Seas to the north, Western Australia to the west, Queensland and Gulf
            of Carpentaria to the east and South Australia to the south. It is approximately 1,000 miles long from north to south and 600 miles long from east to west, covering more than one-sixth of Australia's land area. The climate is predominantly
            tropical in the north, with a semi-arid climate in the far south. Constitutionally, the Territory had a lower status than the states until 1978 and had limited legislative powers until self-government was granted that year. Since its transfer
            from South Australia to the Commonwealth of Australia in 1911, its development has been a major item of expenditure on works, services and inducing producers to accept the risks of an uncertain physical and economic environment... The nature
            of the climate, the poor soils, the distance from assured markets and the problems of recruiting labour have all been considerable obstacles. Nevertheless, the increase in mining activity at the beginning of the 21st century has significantly
            strengthened the economy. Furthermore, since the late 20th century, the Northern Territory's population has been one of the fastest growing in the country; the majority of residents are concentrated in and around the capital, Darwin. It covers
            520,902 square miles. In 2021 the population will have reached 232,605.

        Queensland
        <p>
            Queensland, the north-eastern state of Australia, occupies the wettest and most tropical part of the continent. It is bordered by the Coral Sea to the north and east, New South Wales to the south, South Australia to the southwest and the Northern Territory
            to the west. The capital is Brisbane, located on the state's south-eastern coast. Queensland is the second largest state in Australia, accounting for nearly a quarter of the entire continent. The state is more than twice the size of the US
            state of Texas and seven times the size of the UK. In terms of land occupation, however, Queensland is really the largest state in Australia, occupying a larger area than the whole of Western Australia. It is also the most dispersed continental
            state, with most of its population scattered along the eastern coastline, a distance of 1,400 miles. The rest of the population is dispersed across almost all of its vast interior space becoming thin, posing serious challenges to access and
            communication. Queensland is a vast, sparsely populated state with a resource-based economy, with exports based on livestock, agricultural and mineral products. In contemporary times, Queensland, the self-proclaimed 'Sunshine State', has benefited
            from rapid growth in tourism, with attractions including surf beaches, verdant estuaries, picturesque islands and the Great Barrier Reef, which extends 1,250 miles off the coast of Queensland's Coral Sea. While the already sparsely populated
            inland population continues to decline, the state is also experiencing rapid population growth through the 'sunbelt' migration to more attractive coastal areas. It covers an area of 668,207 square miles. In 2021 the population will have reached
            5,156,138.

        Western Australia
        <p>
            Western Australia, Western Australia occupies the most isolated part of the continent from the major cultural centres to the east. The state is bordered by the Timor Sea to the north, the Indian Ocean to the north-west and west, and the part of the Indian
            Ocean commonly referred to as the Southern Ocean in Australia to the south. To the east is the Northern Territory and the deserts of South Australia. The capital city is Perth.
            <br>
            <br> Western Australia covers approximately one third of the entire continent. It stretches for about 1,490 miles from the tropical north of the monsoon monsoon to the windswept coastal wastelands of the far south. Much of the state is semi-arid,
            with the combination of low rainfall and high temperatures restricting much of the population and agricultural activity to the southern coast of the so-called comfort zone, which stretches from north of Geraldton on the state's west coast
            to the imaginary south-west of Esperance on the state's west coast. The vast majority of the population lives in the Greater Perth area, one of the largest metropolitan areas in Australia. As one of the most remote administrative centres in
            the world, Perth is closer to Jakarta and Singapore than to Sydney in terms of both distance and time zone. It covers an area of 976,790 square miles. The population reaches 2,660,026 in 2021.

        South Australia
        <p>
            South Australia, the south-central state of Australia. It occupies one of the driest and most barren areas of the continent, but its southern edge consists of well-watered, fertile land where most of the population lives. It is bordered by Western Australia
            to the west, the Northern Territory to the north, Queensland to the north and east, and New South Wales and Victoria to the east. It faces south towards the Great Australian Bight, which is the marginal sea of the Southern Indian Ocean. The
            capital is Adelaide, on the southern coast. South Australia covers about one-eighth of Australia's total land area and is the fourth largest of the country's eight states and territories. It has just under eight per cent of Australia's population
            and ranks fifth among the states and territories in terms of population.
            <br>
            <br> The settled part of South Australia forms the western end of the densely populated, crescent-shaped, prolific land mass of south-eastern Australia, which is the economic centre of the country. The state has the strongest commercial links
            with Melbourne and Sydney. It covers an area of 983,482 square kilometres. Population in 2021 accounted for 1,781,516.

        New South Wales
        <p>
            New South Wales, the south-eastern state of Australia, occupies the coastal ranges and inland highlands. It is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, Victoria to the south, South Australia to the west and Queensland to the north. New South Wales also
            includes Lord Howe Island, 360 miles east of the mainland. The state capital is Sydney, the largest city in the country.
            <br> New South Wales was the first British settlement in Australia in 1788 and today is the most populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia and the most industrialised after Victoria.
            <br> Although it is by no means the largest state in Australia by area, NSW has the largest economy of them all and in its demographic, political and economic diversity forms a microcosm of Australia as a whole. It reflects the problems of
            a semi-fringe state adapting to changes in the world economy. Its formerly strong manufacturing base has adapted to competition from cheaper and better products from overseas, and heavy industry has been replaced by the production of carefully
            adapted products. The state's rural industries were similarly faced with world oversupply and declining export prices for what were once major livestock and agricultural products - such as wool, wheat, dairy products and meat - and sought
            to develop more diversified product crops and specialist markets, often with considerable success. Unemployment is relatively high, often above the national average, and there are considerable regional differences. The expansion of the real
            estate, financial and business sectors has contributed a large part of the employment growth since the 1990s, and fluctuations in these areas have likewise had an impact on economic trends across the state. Rapidly growing international tourism
            has stimulated widespread growth in the service sector, although it has increased vulnerability to the global recession, with the arrival of large numbers of tourists putting pressure on facilities and the environment.

            Victoria, in the south-east of Australia, occupies a mountainous coastal region of the continent. Victoria is separated from New South Wales to the north by the Murray River, which is approximately 1,065 miles long, with an additional border of approximately
            110 miles connecting Cape Howe to the nearest source of the Murray River. The western boundary borders South Australia and the southern coastline of the Tasman Sea and Indian Ocean stretches for approximately 1,045 miles, including the Port
            Phillip Bay coastline. Melbourne, the state capital, is located at the end of Bass Strait Sound.
            <br>
            <br> The discovery and exploitation of oil and gas in the Gippsland Basin and Bass Strait from the 1960s onwards gave a major boost to Victoria's economy. Although oil production began to decline in the late 20th century, the state maintained
            its position as the country's main source of gas and oil. Of the Australian states, Victoria is second only to New South Wales in population, production and influence in federal politics. It covers an area of 87,806 square miles. Population
            in 2021 accounted for 6,503,491.

        Tasmania
        <p>
            Tasmania, formerly known as Van Diemensland, is an Australian island state. It lies about 150 miles south of Victoria and is separated from the state by the relatively shallow Bass Strait. Structurally, Tasmania forms the southern extension of the Great
            Dividing Range. The state includes a main island called Tasmania; Bruny Island, immediately off the south-eastern coast of the main island; the Flinders Islands in the King and Bass Straits; a number of small islands off the coast of the main
            island; and the sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island, about 900 miles to the south-east. The main island is roughly heart-shaped, with a maximum length and width of about 200 miles, and has a latitude and climate roughly comparable to that of northern
            California and north-western Spain. Tasmania is slightly larger than Sri Lanka and is the smallest state in Australia. Hobart is the state capital.
            <br>
            <br> The state got its name from the Dutch navigator and explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first European to discover the island in 1642. However, it was not until 1856 that the island became known as Van Diemen's Land, named after
            Anthony Van Diemen, the Governor of the Dutch East Indies who sent Tasman on his expedition. Tasmania is home to some of the country's most spectacular mountain ranges, lakes and coastal scenery and much of its land is protected in national
            parks and reserves. The state also produces most of Australia's hydroelectric power and has a rich diversity of natural resources. Despite this, Tasmania remains one of Australia's poorest states, with a steadily declining proportion of the
            country's population. While the island state sets many aspects of its political, economic and social life apart, its proximity to Melbourne and air travel make Tasmania less isolated and more cosmopolitan than other Australian states are often
            perceived to be. Area 68,401 sq km. Population in 2021 has 557,571.

        Design Decisions
        <p>
            The abstract adjectives I chose to match with the Interaction Design Principles are Stretched and Information Design. my 'stretched' is reflected in the fact that my website starts with a map display, which is a This is the lowest level of presentation.
            A further level of display is to hover over a place and display a picture of the famous landscape of that location. The final stretched is a click on the place and the corresponding presentation is displayed. These three main elements are
            the only ones present in this website, but it is the combination of these elements and the pages that make up my final 'information design'. I designed the site to facilitate the user experience, so that the user knows exactly what step they
            have taken, what step they need to take next, what information they have read and what they need to read... When they are all done, the homepage of the site changes from a map of the countries to a map of the flags. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Combined, as a transfer
            of information, my aim is to give people who do not know the country, have not been there or are planning to travel there a brief introduction to each landmark of the country, these include what the place produces, the surroundings such as
            famous mountains and rivers, climatic conditions, developments in recent years and population numbers, etc., to give the user a scientific overview. Of course words are boring, for me it's the pictures that really attract people, because some
            of the wonders of the landscape are hard to describe in words, so I start by letting the user know the pictures of the most beautiful and stunning places in the state before the text, so that the user can spontaneously choose and see which
            state they want to know more about first. The interactive design of this site is that it acts like a smart encyclopaedia, containing several of the most necessary points of a country: the map, the flag, each state, and the corresponding pictures
            of each state.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also made my site interesting accordingly, to give the viewer more incentive to explore further. For example, if a user likes a state and wants to know more about it, when he clicks on it and then returns he will find
            that place displayed with a pin symbol, indicating that on this site you have already visited and learned about the place, and the site will automatically mark it for you, also as a way to clock in. When the user has clocked in each state,
            the user will find that the original map has been transformed into a flag style filled map, which gives the viewer a sense of how varied and interesting the website interaction can be. The design of the site's silky smooth consistency is reflected
            in the way the image slowly appears when the mouse is placed over the location and slowly disappears when the mouse is removed. Not only that, but when the user clicks on a state, it automatically jumps to the introduction of that state, and
            although they are displayed on one page at the same time, this saves the user a great deal of time. With the design of one page, this can also be satisfying for those users who want to read it all at once, but it does not allow them to successfully
            complete each state's punchline and earn the flag symbol.
